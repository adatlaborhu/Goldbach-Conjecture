# Goldbach-Conjecture
I was curious if the Goldbach Conjecture is true for the first 10.000 primes. The result was more exciting.

(If you don't know what's that - from Wikipedia:
"Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."

1. I took the first 10.000 primes - ends with 104729 - from here: https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/10000.txt
2. Then I took 2 of these primes and summed them. (eg. 3, 5 -–» 3+5=8)
3. I created all the permutations of the 10.000 primes and summed them (3+3, 3+5, 3+7, 3+11, 3+13... ... ... 104729+104723 ,104729+104729).
4. I checked if it gives out all the even integers between 1 and 104729.
5. It gave.
6. I sorted the concluded numbers, and counted the distribution of them.
7. I found that the greater the concluded even integer, the more possibility to create it as the sum of 2 primes. (

It makes me feel more and more that the Goldbach Conjecture MUST be true, but with that of course this is still an unsolved problem.
