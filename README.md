# Goldbach-Conjecture
I was curious if the Goldbach Conjecture is true for the first 10.000 primes. The result was more exciting.

(If you don't know what's that - from Wikipedia:
"Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."

1. There are [TBC, I'm tired]

Of course with that the Goldbach Conjecture is still an unsolved problem. :-(
